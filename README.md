# React Redux Reference Repo

I'm using this repo as a general react/redux reference.

It's a clone of [Stephen Grider's ReactStarter repo](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReactStarter) that I've filled out based on the fourth app built in [this udemy react-redux tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux) with slight modifications for my own note taking/preferences.

#### Quickstart

```
$ brew install node # Skip if you already have node/npm installed
$ git clone https://github.com/lukebergen/react-redux-reference.git
$ cd react-redux-reference
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ # now hit localhost:8080 to see the running app
```
